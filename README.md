# Operating Systems Lab 
This series of projects was developped as part of the 9th semester course, Parallel Processing (of the National Technical University of Athens) taught by Georgios Goumas in the winter semester of 2018. At this project we got accustomed not only with parallel programming apis but also with parallelization techniques . 


## Exercise 1a (/master/ex1a) -- An introduction to OpenMP
At this exercise we parallelized the Game of Life using OpenMP as part of the introduction to this course.

## Exercise 1b (/master/ex1b) -- Paralellizing algorithms using OpenMP , TBB and AVX intrinsics(vectorization).
At this exercise we parallelized different variations of the Floyd Warshall algorithm.

## Exercise 2 (/master/ex2) -- Paralellizing algorithms MPI on distributed systems.
At this exercise we parallelized Jacobi , Gauss-Seidel and Red-Black SOR algorithms using the Message Passing Interface.

## Exercise 3 (/master/ex3) -- Concurrent data types
At this exercise we implemented different lock variations in order to achieve the best perfomance on a concurrent linked list.

## Exercise 4 (/master/ex4) -- Paralellizing algorithms on GPU'S using Cuda API.
At this exercise we implemented different parallel variations of the Matrix-Matrix multiplication kernel using Cuda.
