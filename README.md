# Operating Systems Lab 
This series of projects was developped as part of the 9th semester course, Parallel Processing (of the National Technical University of Athens) taught by Georgios Goumas in the winter semester of 2018. At this project we got accustomed not only with parallel programming apis but also with parallelization techniques .
